# SC4002_NLP

## 1. Our tasks

- 0. Part1(c):

  - Top priority

- 1. Part1(a)(b):
 
  - One person(Please finish it as fast as you can. Others' work will depends on you)

- 2. Part2&Part3(a)(b) -> Train/Improve RNN:

  - Two person
 
- 3. Part3(c)(d)(e)(f) -> Train biLSTM&biGRU, Train cnn(conv1d maybe), Improve (I think fine-tune a BERT is a good choice. As BERT have it's own embedding layers so this is independent with the whole process)

  - Three person(one for )
