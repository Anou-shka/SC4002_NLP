- 2. Part2&Part3(a)(b) -> Train/Improve RNN:
 
  - Train RNN: ...

  - Improve RNN: ...
 
- 3. Part3(c)(d)(e)(f) -> Train biLSTM&biGRU, Train cnn(conv1d maybe), Improve (I think fine-tune a BERT is a good choice. As BERT have it's own embedding layers so this is independent with the whole process)

 
  - Train biGRU & biLSTM (They are basically the same structure): ...

  - Train CNN: ...

  - Improve: Lei Mingcong
