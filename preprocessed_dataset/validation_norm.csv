531,a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration,1
532,the unique niche of selfcritical  behindthescenes navelgazing kaufman has carved from orleans story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality,1

539,it puts washington  as honest working man john q  archibald  on a pedestal  then keeps lifting the pedestal higher,0
540,ultimately  the film amounts to being lectured to by techgeeks  if youre up for that sort of thing,0
541,far more enjoyable than its predecessor,0

577,the lousy lead performances    keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired,0
578,its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious  and schneiders performance is so fine  its a real shame that so much of the movie  again  as in the animal  is a slapdash mess,0
579,creates the worst kind of mythologizing  the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama,0
580,the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation  and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates,0

587,an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound,0
588,mildly amusing,0
589,not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans,0
590,the movie is silly beyond comprehension  and even if it werent silly  it would still be beyond comprehension,0

612,it plods along methodically  somehow under the assumption that its  dead wife communicating from beyond the grave  framework is even remotely new or interesting,0
613,its hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marinas could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom  and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive,0
614,all too familiar    basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when angels with dirty faces appeared in 1938,0
615,passable enough for a shootout in the o  k  court house of life type of flick  strictly middle of the road,0
616,although purportedly a study in modern alienation  its really little more than a particularly slanted  gay sm fantasy  enervating and deadeningly drawnout,0

625,formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip,0
626,everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel,0
627,a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film  but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasnt the stamina for the 100minute running time  and the protagonists bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun,0

641,pottymouthed enough for pg13  yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park  this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults,0
642,has its moments  but ultimately  its curmudgeon doesnt quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites,0

644,most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement,0
645,in the end  tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived  too much to do  too little time to do it in,0
646,rather less than the sum of its underventilated pèrefils confrontations,0
647,mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about  or is illequipped to examine  the interior lives of the characters in his film  much less incorporate them into his narrative,0

651,yes  spirited away is a triumph of imagination  but its also a failure of storytelling,0
652,a characteristically engorged and sloppy comingofage movie,0
653,a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga,0
654,whenever you think youve seen the end of the movie  we cut to a new scene  which also appears to be the end  but  no  we get another scene  and then another  you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain,0
655,an empty  ugly exercise in druggy trancenoir and trumpedup street credibility,0
656,the screenplay  cowritten by director imogen kimmel  lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise  making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing,0
657,the milieu is wholly unconvincing    and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch,0
658,unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups  not much camera movement  and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters,0
659,each story is built on a potentially interesting idea  but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting  while the third feels limited by its short running time,0
660,except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartlebys pain  the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion,0

665,mattei so completely loses himself to the films circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on  well  love in the time of money,0
666,it briefly flirts with player masochism  but the point of real interest  audience sadism  is evaded completely,0
667,holland lets things peter out midway  but its notably better acted  and far less crass  than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals,0

677,like schindlers list  the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent  but ends up merely pretentious  in a grisly sort of way,0
678,an unremittingly ugly movie to look at  listen to  and think about  it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film,0

680,its kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey,0
681,friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite,0
682,its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomachchurning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up,0

684,meandering and confusing,0
685,there are cheesy backdrops  ridiculous action sequences  and many tired jokes about men in heels,0

702,a bizarre piece of work  with premise and dialogue at the level of kids television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy  rape and suspected murder,0
703,paul bettany is good at being the ultraviolent gangster wannabe  but the movie is certainly not number 1,0
704,its a gag thats worn a bit thin over the years  though dont ask still finds a few chuckles,0
705,an uplifting drama    what antwone fisher isnt  however  is original,0
706,often likable  but just as often its meandering  low on energy  and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little oldfashioned storytelling would come in handy,0

711,this tuxedo    should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations,0
712,i have no problem with  difficult  movies  or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out  but first  you have to give the audience a reason to bwantb to put for that effort  and  i,0

720,punchdrunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that  if it were a person  youd want to smash its face in,0

752,im not sure which is worse  the poor acting by the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r  nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen,0
753,the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow,0
754,whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards  someone should dispense the same advice to film directors,0
755,as with so many merchandisedtothemax movies of this type  more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script  which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else,0

763,ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head  but he knows how to pose madonna,0
764,the story  touching though it is  does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature  and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long,0
765,feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired  of fighting the same fights  of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders  of playing with narrative form,0
766,while you have to admit its semiamusing to watch robert deniro belt out  when youre a jet  youre a jet all the way   its equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to  tonight,0

999,a pintsized goodfellas designed to appeal to the younger set  its not a very good movie in any objective sense  but it does mostly hold ones interest,0
1000,get out your pooperscoopers,0

1008,the fourth in a series that ill bet most parents had thought hoped   was a fad that had long since vanished,0
1009,its a long way from orwells dark  intelligent warning cry 1984 to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium  and what once was conviction is now affectation,0

1018,starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary  humorless soap opera,0
1019,while theres likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans  as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbos dumbeddown tactics   much ado about something is an amicable endeavor,0

1023,culkin turns his character into what is basically an antiharry potter  right down to the gryffindor scarf,0
1024,memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and  by extension  its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual,0
1025,its a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good,0
1026,in the nottoodistant future  movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds  right now  theyre merely signposts marking the slow  lingering death of imagination,0
1027,an intriguing nearmiss,0

1032,snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good,0
1033,piccolis performance is amazing  yes  but the symbols of loss and denial and lifeatarmslength in the film seem irritatingly transparent,0
1034,starts out mediocre  spirals downward  and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion,0
1035,nicolas cage isnt the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray  and this movie wont create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career,0
1036,it lacks the compassion  goodnatured humor and the level of insight that made eyres first film something of a sleeper success,0
1037,the result is good gossip  entertainingly delivered  yet with a distinctly musty odour  its expiry date long gone,0
1038,a sustained fest of selfcongratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer,0
1039,all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movies worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise,0
