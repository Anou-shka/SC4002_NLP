904,sade achieves the nearimpossible  it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard,0
905,lin chungs voice is rather unexceptional  even irritating  at least to this western ear   making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters,0

933,the premise itself is just sooooo tired  pair that with really poor comedic writing    and youve got a huge mess,0
934,proves a lovely trifle that  unfortunately  is a little too in love with its own cuteness,0
935,did we really need a remake of  charade,0

937,the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game  you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored,0
938,i spied with my little eye    a mediocre collection of cookiecutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits,0

957,swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and roughhewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell,0
958,the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and  playing a charmless witch  she is merely a charmless witch,0
959,you have no affinity for most of the characters  nothing about them is attractive  what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom,0
960,diaz  applegate  blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert  if not amused,0
961,a technically wellmade suspenser    but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide,0
962,an inept  tedious spoof of 70s kung fu pictures  it contains almost enough chuckles for a threeminute sketch  and no more,0

969,dragonfly dwells on crossingover mumbo jumbo  manipulative sentimentality  and sappy dialogue,0
970,in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter  silberling also  to a certain extent  trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls,0

982,a fullfrontal attack on audience patience,0
983,any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy  there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors,0

1000,it shares the first two films loosejointed structure  but laughoutloud bits are few and far between,0
1001,the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids  but ive got to give it thumbs down,0
1002,you cannot guess why the cast and crew didnt sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed,0
1003,barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull,0

1021,it collapses when mr  taylor tries to shift the tone to a thrillers rush,0
1022,any film that doesnt even in passing mention political prisoners  poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss,0

1025,though there are many tense scenes in trapped  they prove more distressing than suspenseful,0

1035,director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the storys promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself,0
1036,its difficult to imagine that a more confused  less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002,0
1037,like the tuck family themselves  this movie just goes on and on and on and on,0
1038,as pedestrian as they come,0

1041,put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven  west of hell in the pantheon of billy bobs body of work,0
1042,more intellectually scary than dramatically involving,0

1046,you come away thinking not only that kate isnt very bright  but that she hasnt been worth caring about and that maybe she  janine and molly  an allwoman dysfunctional family  deserve one another,0
1047,the metaphors are provocative  but too often  the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery,0
1048,very much a home video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all,0

1053,muddled  trashy and incompetent,0
